# MMGraph

MMGraph is a high-level library designed to simplify the process of training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It provides a flexible and efficient framework for researchers and practitioners working with graph-structured data.

## Structure

MMGraph uses MMEngine for handling training and leverages a modular architecture for flexibility and extensibility. The project is structured as follows:

### Core Components

1. **configs**: Contains configuration files for various experiments and models.

2. **mmgraph**: The main package containing the core functionality.

3. **tests**: Contains unit tests for various components of the library.

### Key Features

- Modular design allowing easy extension and customization of components.
- Integration with MMEngine for efficient training management.
- Support for popular GNN models and datasets from PyG.
- Flexible configuration system for easy experiment setup.
